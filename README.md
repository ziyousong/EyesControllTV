# EyesControllTV
This repository contains a .NET library and a Arduino library that can be used to switching to a channel by eyes.

The .NET library of classes for programmers to make it easy to connect to an arduino via usb, and can catch gaze point data simply.

What you need to know before you begin using this library:

1. Prepare 3 device: Tobii EyeX, IR Transmitter, IR Receiver.
2. This repository includes IRremote Arduino library on github(https://github.com/z3t0/Arduino-IRremote)

##Getting Started
##Arduino
Reference link: https://github.com/z3t0/Arduino-IRremote
###Installation
1. Download ZIP from <a href="https://github.com/ziyousong/EyesControllTV">Homepage</a>.
2. Extract the zip file.
3. Move the "IRremote" folder that has been extracted to your libraries directory.
4. Make sure to delete Arduino_Root/libraries/RobotIRremote. Where Arduino_Root refers to the install directory of Arduino. The library RobotIRremote has similar definitions to IRremote and causes errors.

###Code example: Receive infrared signals
```
#include <IRremote.h>

int RECV_PIN = 11;
IRrecv irrecv(RECV_PIN); // Initialize
decode_results results; // Store infrared signals

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  irrecv.enableIRIn(); // Start the receiver
}

void loop() {
  if(irrecv.decode(&results)){
    Serial.println(results.value,HEX);
    irrecv.resume(); // Prepare to receive next signals
  }
  delay(200);
}
```

###Code example: Send infrared signals
